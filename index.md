We are [Olin College of Engineering's](https://www.olin.edu/) aerial robotics club. Our team works in domains such as computer vision, prediction and strategy algorithms, game simulation, hardware design, and flight control firmware. We share our progress on this site to let others know about our findings and to serve as documentation for ourselves.

Our current goal is building an autonomous multirotor drone capable of solving ["Mission 7"](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/mission7/) of the International Aerial Robotics Competition. Mission 7 is a demanding competition requiring a self-piloting drone to herd a number of quasi-randomly moving robots (Roombas) through an indoor basketball court. The nature of the game, especially the constantly moving targets and an environment that makes it difficult to keep track of the position of the drone, is taxing in all the domains we are interested in. See the video below for more information about the ]competition.

If you or your company can help us find funding we need to register for the competition and buy a few Roombas for enacting a simple competition scenario, [drop us a line on our contact page]({{ "/contact" | relative_url }}).
